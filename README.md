# Collapsible Notifications UI

A sleek, animated collapsible notifications list built with React and Framer Motion. This component stacks notifications with smooth, bouncy transitions when collapsed, adjusting opacity, scale, and position for a visually appealing “stacked cards” effect. On expand, each notification animates down with a staggered motion, and an animated header reappears.

### Features:

- Smooth collapse/expand animations
- Bouncy, spring-like motion
- Stacked card visual style
- Staggered reveal when expanding
- Fully built without Motion+ (premium) features
